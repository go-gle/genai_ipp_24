This repo is made for the Generative AI course 2024. The main aim was to reproduce https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08125 on a toy example of MNIST.
Also, to practice different generative approaches like WGAN, VAE, Diffusion model.
These approaches was quite easy to implement and fit. However, that is not the case for the energy based diffusion models. 
Given our resources we were not able to make it produce anything meaningful. 
The code and the training notebooks are in the models folder
